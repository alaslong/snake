# Description

Oldschool style snake game. Eat the apples to grow the snake.

The more apples you eat, you higher your score is.

# Instructions

Control the direction of the snake using the arrow keys.

*Note: You can not reverse direction. e.g. When moving vertically, you can only turn left/right & when moving horizontally, you can only turn upwards/downwards.*

Each time you eat an apple, the snake will get longer. As the snake gets longer, the speed of the game will increase.
